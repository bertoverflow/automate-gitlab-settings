# There are currently three options for merge_method to choose from: 
# merge: A merge commit is created for every merge, and merging is allowed as long as there are no conflicts.
# rebase_merge: A merge commit is created for every merge, but merging is only allowed if fast-forward merge is possible. This way you could make sure that if this merge request would build, after merging to target branch it would also build.
# ff: No merge commits are created and all merges are fast-forwarded, which means that merging is only allowed if the branch could be fast-forwarded
